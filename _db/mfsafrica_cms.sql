Key needs include content streaming, making cross border payments and sending money back home to relatives and friends.</p><p>Africa’s booming mobile money services twinned with informal businesses coming online presents an opportunity for the expansion of online sales into newer markets across the continent.</p><p>Evidence of this can be found in the emerging Fintech industry, with 564 startups across the continent&nbsp;<font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">raising a record $2 billion in 2021.</font>&nbsp;Nigeria has become a shining example for the continent, having raised&nbsp;<font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">$1 billion in 2021</font>. Their fintech ecosystem brought in 73.5% of all of the funds raised by startups in Africa’s most populous country. Although, this kind of funding doesn’t tell the full story.</p><p>Companies don’t need to make large financial outlays to set up physical offices or a cross-border payments system to grab hold of these opportunities. Businesses can expand into new territories with a simple financial presence and the right payment partner.</p><p>Think: duplicating your service from one market to another, and just putting in place the right payment infrastructure.</p><p>A robust fintech solution should do the heavy lifting for clients by solving their revenue collection and payments challenges, reducing operational costs and leaving these companies free to focus on what they are best at: their core operations. Businesses simply need to partner with companies that have the necessary digital payments and transacting infrastructure in place and capitalise on their switches and platforms to reach newer markets.</p><p><br></p><p>Mobile money</p><p><br></p><p>On a continent like Africa where mainstream banking services are few and far between, mobile money must form part of a company’s payment options. Mobile payments and mobile wallets are becoming integral to Africa’s payments ecosystem; for example, in Kenya, a recent&nbsp;<font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">central bank survey</font>&nbsp;found that mobile wallets account for about 32% of all remittance receipts. Companies looking to cross borders with their services must then integrate mobile wallets into their transacting and payments platforms.</p><p>The market in Africa has a very promising future, with&nbsp;<font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">predictions</font>&nbsp;showing that it is set to grow by 22.2% between 2022 and 2028, having already doubled between 2017 and 2021.</p><p>But given the red tape to obtain the necessary permits and approvals from each country’s regulators, hacking together a cross border payment system on their own should be the last thing that a company should be doing to build scale. They don’t need the additional hassles of navigating various bureaucracies, high costs and creating niche expertise.</p><p>Instead, getting the right payment partner in place is necessary. Such a partner will help potential customers using mobile money plug into a pan-Africa cross border payment system to purchase your services and products - even if they have low or no-tech access.</p><p>This means working with a payment provider that has invested in last-mile fintech infrastructures such as cash-in cash-out platforms, point of sale, mobile wallet interoperability and the necessary enabling agent networks. Not everyone has a smartphone in Africa, after all. This is exemplified by the 91%, 80%, and 79%&nbsp;<font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">mobile phone ownership</font>&nbsp;rates in South Africa, Ghana, and Senegal respectively – although the corresponding values for smartphone ownership are 51%, 34%, and 46%, respectively. You don’t want to lose a potential customer because you don’t have the means for them to pay you. Many mobile wallets are based on the USSD feature phone function offering easy access to potential customers.</p><p>There are companies in Africa that have focused on building and developing fintech and digital payments infrastructure to lessen the burden of the continent’s digital businesses investing in physical offices and own cross border payments capabilities. After all, Africa is vast and each market is unique. This means that you need a cross-border payments company that understands the payments ecosystem in each country, banding these together under one switch.<br></p><p><br></p><p>African Free Trade</p><p><br></p><p>And there’s never been a better time to expand a company’s services across the continent than now. The Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) presents an opportune moment for companies looking to expand to new markets. Making up one of the world’s largest trading blocks by areas and boasting over 1 billion consumers, AfCFTA and its payment mechanism, the Pan African Payment Settlement System, are premised on making cross-border transactions seamless. It’s also determined to save <font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">the continent $5 billion in fees</font> from financial transactions that have typically flowed off-shore historically.</p><p>Platforms such as PAPSS, which is backed by a $3 billion settlement guarantee from Afreximbank, will enable companies to scale their offerings to new markets by accepting payments from customers regardless of location - and catering to entrepreneurs, SMEs and traders.</p><p>Companies interested in expanding to new African markets must meet the opportunity presented by AfCFTA and PAPSS. The nature of Africa’s historical financial sector architecture favours legacy banks that are limited in terms of geographical coverage, imposing gaps in reach and limitations on accessibility. Fintech offers the cross-border payments mechanism that will make the dream of AfCFTA a reality in a continent where huge swathes of the population and many merchants do not have access to formal banking.</p><p>The <font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">most unbanked countries in Africa </font>are Morocco, Egypt, and Nigeria, with 36.9 million (71%), 102.3 million (69%), and 206.1 million (60%) people being excluded from formal financial services, respectively. Internet penetration in these countries stands at 62%, 45%, and 70%, presenting an opportunity to open access to large swathes of the population.</p><p>A lack of financial infrastructure, poor integration of platforms and regulatory hurdles have previously inhibited interoperability and the cross-border payments innovations that are key for scaling access across Africa. For instance, remittances are quite important to African countries, yet the cost of sending money between African countries remains high. In Ghana, for example, the <font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">average cost of sending remittances</font> was 7.43% in 2020. In Kenya, that was 8.45%, in Malawi, it was 16.26%, and in South Africa, it was 8.14%. Billions are being lost to transaction costs and Fintech solutions for cross-border payments can significantly reduce the money lost to legacy financial institutions.</p><p>But that’s finally starting to change, presenting an incredible opportunity to companies looking to scale access. Fintech companies such as MFS Africa have been solving cross-border payments challenges on the continent for years, boosting the ability of African businesses and individuals to send and receive money across barriers in the form of borders.</p><p>Our <font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">recent acquisition of cash-in cash-out operator Baxi</font> in Nigeria demonstrates our commitment to including last-mile users with limited tech access into our payment network. And regulators have been coming to the party too. Central banks from <font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">Kenya, Namibia, and even Zimbabwe</font> have been bumping up their regulatory preparedness to embrace e-commerce, fintech and digital payments.</p><p>This together with the cross-border payment system moves being made by PAPSS has created a zeitgeist of intra-African access. It would be a tragedy to be left behind as a company. To take advantage of the moment, you need the right partner.</p><p><br></p><p>Our solution</p><p><br></p><p>MFS African has already integrated into PAPSS and is primed to provide greater access to other fintech, e-commerce, finance institutions and mobile wallets to reach the entire continent. Mobile wallets can be harnessed to power-up cross border remittances and to process payments by companies for supplies or stock.</p><p>MFS Africa provides access through its cross-border payment switch that connects 320 million mobile wallets across 30 African markets. We operate across more than 600 payment corridors on the continent, making cross border payments seamless and remittances ubiquitous. SMEs, merchants, mobile companies and financial institutions also have the chance to scale up access across the continent by partnering with MFS Africa, and our ready presence in much of the continent.</p><p>For us at MFS Africa, there should be no barrier to selling services from one African country to the other.

So interoperability became our mission.</p><p><br></p><p>Today MFS Africa is the leading player in connecting mobile wallets in Africa, reaching nearly 320 million mobile money pockets on the continent. And Mxolisi\'s team handles the nuts and bolts that make that possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Msutwana has years of experience in the telecommunications industry on the African continent and has brought that expertise to bear on financial transactions.</p><p><br></p><p>“We wanted to connect different mobile money schemes together, across different markets,” he says. “We know that telcos have their own platform providers that they prefer that they use, and these platform providers use their own proprietary technology. We needed our technology to be platform agnostic so that whatever platform is used, you will be able to connect and transact through the hub.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Network Operations team also oversees the expansion of MFS Africa\'s network across Africa, allowing more mobile money users to send money through its hub of mobile operators and mobile carriers.</p><p><br></p><p>This means more entrepreneurs and traders who can easily send money across the border to their families and at a low cost. On a continent where remittances are a lifeline to many communities, MFS Africa knows how important this work is.</p><p><br></p><p>That\'s why we want to make our services available more widely.

This was the question that kept me awake when I founded MFS Africa nearly a decade ago. Why does someone in Benin, my home country, face such limited options when it comes to engaging with the global economy, compared to someone sitting in Paris or New York? Throughout our journey to enable simple and relevant financial services for mobile users, we have realised a few realities about what today\'s African consumer wants, and I think it\'s time to update the conventional wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p><font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">The face of Africa\'s typical consumer is changing</font>. A decade ago, we tended to imagine the typical African consumer as an older, rural woman. She might work as a seamstress or a market woman, doing business locally. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the closed-loop, domestic-only mobile money systems developed over ten years ago catered to that type of customer. But today\'s African consumer is young, urban, and globally connected: She\'s a digital native, using her phone to follow Liverpool on Champion\'s League, and to watch music videos from Solange and Sauti Sol. She chats to friends across the continent and beyond over social media. Borders don\'t matter to her when it comes to entertainment and communication - why should they limit her financial freedom?</p><p><br></p><p><font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">Consumers care about the service, not the platform.</font> Historically, the relationship between banks and mobile money or fintech has been painted as combative. The reality is that there is more opportunity for synergy if you take a customer-centric approach. MFS Africa\'s partnership with Ecobank is a prime example of this - enabling banking customers to transact seamlessly to mobile wallet users, wherever they are. Forward-looking banks realise that the future is mobile-first and that they can delight their customers by providing a wide array of payment options.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><font color=\"#000000\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">The line between the “diaspora” and “local” is more blurred than ever.</font> We used to think about the diaspora and remittances in terms of “north” and “south” - London\'to Lagos, Paris to Dakar. But in reality, nearly as much money is sent in remittances between countries of the so-called global south as is received by those countries from the industrialised north. The reality is that over 70% of sub-Saharan migration is to other African countries! A businessman who splits his time between Lagos, Accra, and Johannesburg wants to access the same range of financial services in each location, and should not accept that his ability to make a payment to his daughter\'s school would depend on which country he happens to be in when they are due. This interconnected pan-African reality makes the interoperability of digital financial services even more pressing.</p><p><br></p><p>“Interoperability of digital financial services” may sound like a jargon-packed phrase, but let me put it in simple, human terms: When my brother in Ouagadougou sends money to our mother in Porto-Novo, it doesn t matter which network he sends from, or whether he uses a bank or mobile money network. All he needs is our mother\'s phone number. When he travels to Nairobi for business, he can withdraw cash from his own account from a local M-Pesa agent. When he wants to pay his driver in Accra, a mobile payment takes mere seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>We make interoperability a reality by offering our partners a “one-stop” shop to reach over 320 million connected mobile wallets and tens of millions of bank accounts across the continent through a single API.

MFS Africa will extend the reach of the PAPSS network to over 320 million mobile money and last mile users across 35 African markets, enabling borderless and seamless possibilities for transactions and trade.</p><p><br></p><p>The partnership will empower the millions of semi-formal small and micro-African businesses who are too often left behind. This collaboration marks a new phase in driving the transformational potential of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).</p><p><br></p><p>Founder and CEO of MFS Africa, Dare Okoudjou, said: “At MFS Africa we have always believed that Africans are not limited by borders and that their money should not be either. The interchangeability of African currencies is still very limited after decades of independence, meaning that intra-Africa trade too often relies on hard currencies, hampering the growth of intra-African trade and our continent’s economies. By making cross-border payments affordable and easier, PAPSS gives Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), entrepreneurs and traders easier access to the formal payments services that will help them grow their businesses. Direct currency tradability and interchangeability removes many of the barriers to intra-African trade and investments, facilitates the natural directions of trade flows amongst African countries and regions, and makes borders matter less.”</p><p><br></p><p>CEO of PAPSS, Mike Ogbalu III, said: “Africa is the global leader in mobile money services. A recent study found that 64% of the daily global transactions through mobile money platforms in 2020 happened in sub-Saharan Africa. This demonstrates how mobile money services play a key role in the economic growth of the continent and facilitates financial inclusion. To that end, partnering with MFS Africa will open the way to millions more cross-border mobile money transactions and mark a new phase in driving the benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Area.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System will be the enabling infrastructure to spur the growth of intra-African trade and commerce, with the active participation of central banks, financial institutions, regional economic communities, the private sector and other stakeholders.”</p><p><br></p><p>According to Afreximbank, over 80% of African cross-border transactions originating from the continent’s banks are currently cleared and settled offshore, creating inefficiencies, and increasing the cost of African cross-border payments. PAPSS, an initiative spearheaded by Afreximbank and supported by the African Union, is a centralised payment and settlement infrastructure that aims to increase intra-African trade and commerce by simplifying and reducing the cost of clearing and settling between African countries. PAPSS enables both payment and settlement to be made in the respective local currencies of the buyer and seller. It will also result in a reduction in the cost, administration and time taken to make cross-border payments, resulting in estimated US$5 billion saving in transaction costs every year for Africa.</p><p><br></p><p>MFS Africa’s network provides mobile money interoperability at scale in Africa. Mobile money and last mile users - who are often underbanked semi-formal small and micro businesses trading across borders - stand to gain the most from this partnership. Digital cross-border trade using local currencies will enable more of these businesses to use formal, affordable and convenient channels for trade payments and collections.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02-17 00:00:00', 1, 0, '2022-05-20 05:16:48', '2022-05-20 05:16:48'),

Based on the 2021 State of the Industry report on Mobile Money&nbsp; released by the GSMA, this means that the company covers 60% of all mobile money wallets in sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The MFS Africa partnership with Xoom , a PayPal service, which connects the diaspora in the UK, US, Canada and Europe to mobile wallets in Cameroon, Ghana, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe via the MFS Africa Hub was also mentioned as one of the 12 key highlights for the industry in this year’s report.

The new numbers released by the GSMA have now removed any lingering doubts about that. We also wagered that through our work, these accounts would be able to exchange value with each other and with the rest of the world, in the same way we communicate with each other by mobile phones. We are now in a</p><p><br></p><p>position to make that a reality for over 320 million accounts in Africa. This means that a tech company in Liberia can now gun for a market 64x the size of its home market – underlining the positive economic impact that creating new financial pathways can create.”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the most developed market for mobile money, accounting for roughly two-thirds of global mobile money transactions in 2020, and there is a huge opportunity to leverage this growing popularity to encourage entrepreneurship and growth not just on the continent but across the world. However, more complex transactions, such as those across borders or involving distinct financial institutions, can be costly and inconvenient for African consumers and businesses. The high cost of remittances on the continent (8.9% in the last quarter of 2019) is just one example.

Money transfer operators face greater friction in lowering distribution costs and allowing consumers to make international remittances to and from wallets.
